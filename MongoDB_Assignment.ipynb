    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans. MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format, using JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. MongoDB is designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and polymorphic data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, differ from traditional relational databases in that they do not use a fixed schema for storing data. This means that non-relational databases can handle a wide variety of data types and structures, making them more flexible and scalable than traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-relational databases are often preferred in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The data is unstructured or semi-structured\n",
    "-> The data is too large or too complex to be stored in a \n",
    "-> relational database\n",
    "-> The application requires high scalability and performance\n",
    "-> The application requires real-time data analysis and processing\n",
    "-> The application requires flexible schema design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The application requires a flexible schema design to handle complex and changing data structures\n",
    "-> The application requires high scalability and performance for large-scale data processing and storage\n",
    "-> The application requires fast reads and writes for real-time data processing\n",
    "-> The application requires distributed data storage and processing across multiple servers or nodes\n",
    "-> The application needs to handle unstructured data such as text, images, or videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall, MongoDB is well-suited for applications that require scalability, high performance, and flexible schema design. It's often used in areas such as e-commerce, social media, content management, and big data analytics, where the ability to store and process large amounts of unstructured data is crucial."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "#### Ans. unstructured, semi-structured, and polymorphic data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "1. Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's document-oriented data model is designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. This flexible schema allows developers to store data in a more natural format without needing to predefine a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB's distributed architecture makes it easy to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster. This means that as the amount of data stored in MongoDB increases, the database can scale to handle the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Availability: MongoDB provides high availability through automatic failover and replication. In a replica set, multiple MongoDB instances are configured to provide redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring that the database is always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Indexing: MongoDB supports a wide variety of indexing techniques, including multi-key indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes. This allows developers to optimize queries for specific use cases and improve the performance of their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Aggregation: MongoDB provides powerful aggregation capabilities that allow developers to perform complex queries and data transformations. Aggregation pipelines allow developers to combine multiple stages of data processing into a single query, making it easy to work with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports a wide range of query types, including range queries, regular expressions, and full-text search. This makes it easy to find the data you need, regardless of its structure or format.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Document-based Transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, making it easy to maintain data consistency across multiple documents in a single operation."

    "## Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "### Ans.In MongoDB, the delete_one() and delete_many() methods are used to remove documents from a collection. The drop() method is used to drop an entire collection from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's an explanation of when to use each of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  delete_one() - This method is used to delete the first document in the collection that matches the specified filter. This method is useful when you want to remove a single document from a collection.\n",
    "myquery = { \"address\": \"123 Main St\" }\n",
    "mycol.delete_one(myquery)\n",
    "This would delete the first document in the collection where the \"address\" field equals \"123 Main St\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  delete_many() - This method is used to delete all documents in the collection that match the specified filter. This method is useful when you want to remove multiple documents from a collection.\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "myquery = { \"address\": {\"$regex\": \"^4\"} }\n",
    "mycol.delete_many(myquery)\n",
    "This would delete all documents in the collection where the \"address\" field starts with \"4\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  'drop()' - This method is used to drop an entire collection from a database. This method is useful when you want to completely remove a collection and all of its documents.\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "mycol.drop()\n",
    "\n",
    "This would drop the entire \"customers\" collection from the \"mydatabase\" database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when using the delete_one() and delete_many() methods, you should be careful to ensure that you are deleting the correct documents. It's a good practice to always test your filters with the find() method before using the delete_one() or delete_many() method to ensure that you are targeting the correct documents."
